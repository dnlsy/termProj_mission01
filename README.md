Exercise making **Figure5B** in **Cho, Jun, et al. "LIN28A is a suppressor of ER-associated translation in embryonic stem cells." *Cell* 151.4 (2012): 765-777**.



### 1. *CoLab_termProj_provided.ipynb* (provided previously)

   * Data generation to investigate the correlation between CLIP enrichment and RPF density change in LIN28A-knockdown cells.

   * Acquired the transcript count table from from provided data.  

   Run cells as presented on the jupyter notebook.

​    


### 2. *mission01.Rmd* and *mission01.html* 

   * Imported data: the transcript count table and protein localization information for genes

   * Removed extremes and adjusted the cut-off for a better visualization

   * Merged subcellular location information to the transcript count table    

   * Optimized the graph

   Worked in Rmarkdown `.Rmd` 

​    

### 3. Output files: mission01.html and mission01.md

* Rmarkdown outputs in `.html` and `.md`
* `.md` viewable directly in Github
